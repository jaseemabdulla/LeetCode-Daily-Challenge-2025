    "\n",
    "Given an array `nums` and a list of `queries`, where each query is a range `[start, end]`, each query can decrement all `nums[i]` in the interval `[start, end]` by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to **remove the minimum number of queries** so that the remaining ones can reduce every element in `nums` to 0.  \n",
    "Return the **maximum number of queries that can be removed**.  \n",
    "If it's not possible, return `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ’¡ Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "- We simulate applying the queries greedily:\n",
    "  - For each index `i`, we must ensure `nums[i]` is decremented `nums[i]` times.\n",
    "  - Use a **heap** to manage active intervals efficiently.\n",
    "  - For each `nums[i]`, check if existing intervals are enough to meet the need; if not, apply new intervals.\n",
    "  - Track when removals \"expire\" via a differential array."
