    "You are given a directed graph where each node has at most one outgoing edge. The graph is represented as an array `edges`, where `edges[i]` is the node that node `i` points to, or `-1` if it doesn't point anywhere.\n",

Your task is to find the **closest meeting node**, i.e., a node that is reachable from both `node1` and `node2`, such that the **maximum of the distances** from `node1` and `node2` to this node is **minimized**. If multiple answers exist, return the node with the **smallest index**."
