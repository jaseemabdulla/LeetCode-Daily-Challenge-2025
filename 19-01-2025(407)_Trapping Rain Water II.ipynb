    "# Intuition\n",
    "The problem requires calculating the amount of water trapped after raining on a 3D surface. Each cell has a height, and water can be trapped if there are taller cells surrounding it. The approach uses a **priority queue (min-heap)** to simulate water flow and ensure the lowest height is processed first.\n"

    "# Approach\n",
    "1. **Initialize**:\n",
    "   - Use a priority queue (min-heap) to process boundary cells first.\n",
    "   - Maintain a `visited` matrix to avoid reprocessing cells.\n",
    "   - Add all boundary cells to the heap and mark them as visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Simulate Water Flow**:\n",
    "   - Process the heap:\n",
    "     - Pop the cell with the smallest height.\n",
    "     - For its 4 neighbors, calculate the water that can be trapped (`max(0, current_height - neighbor_height)`).\n",
    "     - Push the neighbor into the heap with an updated height of `max(current_height, neighbor_height)` and mark it as visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Return Result**:\n",
    "   - Accumulate trapped water during the process and return the total."
