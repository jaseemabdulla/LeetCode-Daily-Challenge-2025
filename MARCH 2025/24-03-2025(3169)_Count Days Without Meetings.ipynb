    "# Count Days Without Meetings (Python 2 Version)\n",

    "## Problem Statement  \n",
    "Given the total number of working days (`days`) and a list of meeting schedules (`meetings`), find the number of days without any scheduled meetings.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Approach  \n",
    "1. **Sorting and Merging Meetings:**  \n",
    "   - First, sort the meetings by their start and end days.\n",
    "   - Merge overlapping or consecutive meetings to get the actual busy days.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Counting Free Days:**  \n",
    "   - Calculate free days before the first merged meeting and after the last merged meeting.\n",
    "   - Count the gaps (free days) between merged meetings."
