    "## Problem Statement  \n",
    "You are given an integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` represents the money stored in the `i`-th house. You also have an integer `k`, which represents the number of houses you need to rob.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent alerting the police, **you cannot rob two adjacent houses**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Return the **minimum capability** required to rob exactly `k` houses, where **capability** is the maximum money stored in any of the robbed houses.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach  \n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ **Binary Search on Capability**  \n",
    "1. **Define the Search Space:**  \n",
    "   - The **minimum** capability is `min(nums)`, because the lowest amount a house can store is at least that value.  \n",
    "   - The **maximum** capability is `max(nums)`, since we must consider robbing the richest house.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check Feasibility Using a Helper Function:**  \n",
    "   - We use a helper function `canRobAtLeastK(nums, capability, k)`, which checks whether it is possible to rob **at least `k` houses** without robbing adjacent ones, while ensuring the capability is within `mid`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Binary Search for the Minimum Valid Capability:**  \n",
    "   - If it is **possible** to rob at least `k` houses with `mid` capability, try lowering `mid`.  \n",
    "   - Otherwise, increase `mid` to allow higher capability.  \n",
    "   - Continue until `left` and `right` converge, which gives the minimum capability needed.\n"
