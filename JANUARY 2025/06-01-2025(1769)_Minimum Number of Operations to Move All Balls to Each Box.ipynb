    "# Intuition\n",
    "The goal is to calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all balls in a binary string `boxes` to each position. For a position `i`, we calculate the sum of the absolute distances between `i` and the positions of all the balls ('1').\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of recalculating the distances for every position, we can optimize this using a prefix-sum-like approach.\n"

    "1. **Initial Setup**:\n",
    "   - Identify all indices where there are balls ('1') and store them in a list `P`.\n",
    "   - Compute the initial operations required to move all balls to the first position.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dynamic Calculation**:\n",
    "   - Use two variables `L` (number of balls to the left of the current index) and `R` (number of balls to the right of the current index).\n",
    "   - As we move from left to right, update the count of balls on the left and right based on the current index.\n",
    "   - Update the operation count dynamically for each position using the difference in left and right contributions.\n"
