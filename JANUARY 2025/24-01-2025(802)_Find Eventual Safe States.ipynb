    "# Problem Explanation\n",
    "We aim to find all \"eventual safe nodes\" in a directed graph. A node is safe if:\n",
    "1. It is a terminal node (i.e., no outgoing edges).\n",
    "2. Every path starting from that node eventually leads to a terminal node.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be achieved using a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach and marking nodes based on whether they are part of a cycle.\n"

    "# Approach\n",
    "### **DFS with Cycle Detection**\n",
    "1. **Visited States**:\n",
    "   - `0`: Node is unvisited.\n",
    "   - `1`: Node is being visited (part of the current DFS path).\n",
    "   - `2`: Node is fully processed (safe).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cycle Detection**:\n",
    "   - If a node is visited during the DFS (`visited[index] == 1`), it means we found a cycle.\n",
    "   - Mark nodes leading to a cycle as unsafe.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **DFS Traversal**:\n",
    "   - For each node, check if it's part of a cycle.\n",
    "   - If it's not part of a cycle, mark it as safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Result**:\n",
    "   - Collect all nodes that are marked as safe."
